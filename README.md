# Assessing the Livability of NYC Neighborhoods
This is a report from the final project we worked on in the Realtime and Big Data Analytics class.

Livability is a very subjective term, and the likelihood of an area being described as livable is heavily influenced by the expectations of the individual(s) evaluating it. In order to disambiguate this, our report begins by describing one potential definition of livability and subsequently proceeds to rank several neighborhoods of New York City based on this definition. We also analyze the contribution of different factors towards the overall livability of a particular locality.

Our findings are described in the report.
